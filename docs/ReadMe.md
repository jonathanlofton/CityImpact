# CityImpact

## Background and Overview
CityImpact is a mobile application that enables users to share community-based issues and host events to solve these issues, host events for these issues, and host events for community events. Functionality, ease-of-use, and an intuitive user interface will make it easy for users to post issues and come together resolve those issues. If a user sees an issue in their community, he/she can ping the issue on the map for awareness or organize a community service event for the issue.
